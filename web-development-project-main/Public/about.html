                <p>Hello! Iâ€™m Tre Haynes, a dedicated junior at Kennesaw State University, majoring in Information Technology. My journey began in Maryland, where I was born on October 16th, and has since taken me to Union City, Georgia, where I was raised. Growing up, my interest in technology flourished, guiding me toward a career in IT. Through my studies at KSU, I have gained foundational skills in various programming languages and a deep understanding of tech concepts that fuel my excitement for this field.</p>

                <p>My time at KSU has been filled with hands-on learning and meaningful projects, where I have been able to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. From building my first PC in high school to diving deep into coding, I have developed a strong technical skill set in Java, Python, JavaScript, and Swift. These experiences have only increased my drive to understand the intricacies of technology and to innovate within the IT landscape.</p>

                <p>Looking ahead, I am eager to continue growing as a professional in IT, with aspirations to make a meaningful impact in the tech world. My goal is to use my skills and knowledge to create solutions that not only meet but exceed the needs of users. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I hope my portfolio provides a glimpse into my passion and dedication to the field of Information Technology.</p>
